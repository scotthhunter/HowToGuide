<h2>Plan your bakery</h2>

<h3>1. Select the kind of bakery you'd like to open</h3>
<br>
<p>One of the first decisions you will have to make is the kind of shop you want to open. To do this, you will want to assess your talents, budget, and goals. Be sure you’re not making this decision in a bubble—you will want to have your ear to the ground on national trends in the industry—remember the cupcake shop craze (and the cupcake-focused reality TV shows) a few years back? But don’t simply take your findings at face value either. It's equally important to do local market research to figure out how national currents will affect your particular location and demographic. From there: take a look at the list below and decide which one is right for you.</p>
<br>

<h3>Online. You don't need a storefront to open a bakery.</h3>

<br>
<p>You can start out online. With a killer website, pictures of your work, and a way to place an order, you can run it from your home.
Counter service. With a small commercial space, customers can walk in and pick up baked goods from an employee-managed counter.
Specialty service. If you plan to specialize in a certain kind of baked good, a specialty service is your best option. Whether you run the business from your home or rent a space is up to you.
<br>

Sit down. More owners are trying to capitalize on the sit-down and dine option. It’s a growing trend in the bakery industry right now. Picture a space that has both an area to order baked goods and spot to sit and enjoy them.</p>


<h3>2. Write a business plan</h3>
<p>
Once you know what kind of bakery you want to open, you need to create a business plan. This will force you to look at the business from every angle. It will help you define your business, set goals, find ways to generate revenue, list expenses, identify your customer base, and examine your competition.</p>
<br>

<h3>3Assess your startup funds</h3>
<p>

As part of your business plan, you’ll dive into finances. One of the numbers you’ll need to generate is startup cost.You’ll need to compile a list of equipment, from appliances like ovens and refrigerators, to smaller items like utensils and pans. Make sure you create a full list of tools. The equipment will be a one-time hit, but you’ll also need money to live on while the business gets established.

You won’t make profits overnight, so you need to sit down and figure out when you’ll break even and how much money you’ll need to survive until that time.
